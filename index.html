    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Jonathan is a young (hopefully still) advertising professional living in Chicago. Jonathan is trying his best to learn coding but the experience is not always easy. He has found that by focusing on one specific task at a time it is easier to stay focused then
      if he were to try and do a lot of things at once. Also he has found that weekends tend to provide a lot of distractions from doing
      his homework.
